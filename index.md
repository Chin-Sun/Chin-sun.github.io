Just your average everyday nerd, developer, gym enthusiast.

The business side of this blog is mostly about SQL Server, Web Development, programming tips and tools.

I also like to post about my hobbies...reading, shopping, nerdy home projects, swimming and whatever else I seem to be obsessing over that month.

Hope you enjoy what you're reading here!
